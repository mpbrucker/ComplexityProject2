### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

The team is replicating a spacial IPD, exploring how migration and noise affect the emergence of cooperation. The explanation is quite thorough, especially explaining Prisoner’s Dilemma. 

### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

I understand the methodology on a higher level, I’m unclear on how the trust network is initially built.

### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

Not much to work with here - it looks like you have some figures planned out that highlight the effects of various aspects of your extension.

### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

Yes, in that it finds that noisy conditions do produce communities of cooperators. The original proposition seems reasonable.

### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the 

Yes? It would be nice to see some figures of both your replication and the original paper to compare.

### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

Yes. The two extensions are explained pretty thoroughly and ask compelling questions. My understanding is that both are done with the goal of creating a closer approximation of social circles in the real world.

### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

It’s unclear on if more experiments need to be run or if the figures simply need to be dropped in. The extensions are clearly defined.

### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

The writing is clear, and the tense is correct. The section could be broken up a bit to help with visual reading.

### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

Is it a spacial PD or spacial IPD?
