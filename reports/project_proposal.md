## Our Project
### Evan Lloyd New-Schmidt and Matt Brucker

2) An abstract that identifies the topics you intend to investigate and the tools you plan to use.

3) An annotated bibliography of 3-5 papers that relate to your topic and/or tools.  Explain what the papers are about, what experiments they report, and what their primary conclusions are.

4) Present 1-3 experiments from these papers that you plan to replicate and 1-3 extensions or variations of those experiments you are considering.

5) Sketch what the results from these experiments might look like, possibly using a cartoon of a graphical result.

6) Explain how you will interpret the results; for example, "If the power spectrum on a log-log scale is approximately linear, we will estimate its slope.  If that slope is near 1, we will conclude that the time series generated by model resembles pink noise."

7) Identify causes for concern.  Review the criteria for what makes a good project, (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and identify any areas where your project might be problematic.

8) Outline next steps.  For each team member, what do you plan to work on immediately?  For the team, what do you think you can get done in the first week?  Consider using Trello (or a similar tool) to delegate and track tasks.
