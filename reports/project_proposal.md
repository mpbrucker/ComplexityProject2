Extension #1: Investigate other properties of SOC


### Abstract

In this paper, we intend to explore properties of earthquakes - particularly the properties of self-organized criticality (SOC) they exhibit. To this end, we will replicate the experiment conducted by Olami, Feder, and Christensen. They build a model of earthquakes using a sliding block model consisting of a 2D grid of blocks sitting on a fixed plane and attached via springs to a moving plane; each block is connected to its neighboring blocks with more springs. Once the force on a block due to the movement of the plate exceeds the force of static friction on the block, it will come loose and move, distributing its force to its neighbors. With enough force on a block, a chain reaction can occur, causing a fully formed earthquake. They find that the earthquakes in their simulation exhibit a power-law distribution, with an interesting property: the exponent of the power-law distribution depends on the elasticicity parameter, which is a parameter that controls the conservation of energy when a block slides. We intend to replicate their experiment, and further investigate several properties. First, we will see whether the system exhibits SOC properties beyond just power-law distributions, which is the only property observed in the paper - i.e, we will explore whether they exhibit fractal geometry and pink noise. Second, we will investigate how the distribution of forces on each block affects the system; in Olami et al., the initial forces are randomly distributed. We intend to create "fault lines," which are clusters of blocks that begin with a high initial force on them, and explore how these clusters affect the behavior of the system as well as its SOC properties.

2) An abstract that identifies the topics you intend to investigate and the tools you plan to use.

3) An annotated bibliography of 3-5 papers that relate to your topic and/or tools.  Explain what the papers are about, what experiments they report, and what their primary conclusions are.

4) Present 1-3 experiments from these papers that you plan to replicate and 1-3 extensions or variations of those experiments you are considering.

5) Sketch what the results from these experiments might look like, possibly using a cartoon of a graphical result.

6) Explain how you will interpret the results; for example, "If the power spectrum on a log-log scale is approximately linear, we will estimate its slope.  If that slope is near 1, we will conclude that the time series generated by model resembles pink noise."

7) Identify causes for concern.  Review the criteria for what makes a good project, (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and identify any areas where your project might be problematic.

8) Outline next steps.  For each team member, what do you plan to work on immediately?  For the team, what do you think you can get done in the first week?  Consider using Trello (or a similar tool) to delegate and track tasks.
