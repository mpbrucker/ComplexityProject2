Extension #1: Investigate other properties of SOC


### Abstract

In this paper, we intend to explore whether earthquakes, as modeled by cellular automata, exhibit the properties of self-organized criticality (SOC), and under what conditions they exhibit these properties. To this end, we will replicate the experiment conducted by Olami, Feder, and Christensen. They build a model of earthquakes using a sliding block model consisting of a 2D grid of blocks sitting on a fixed plane and attached via springs to a moving plane; each block is connected to its neighboring blocks with more springs. Once the force on a block due to the movement of the plate exceeds the force of static friction on the block, it will come loose and move, distributing its force to its neighbors. With enough force on a block, a chain reaction can occur, causing a fully formed earthquake. They find that the earthquakes in their simulation exhibit a power-law distribution, with an interesting property: the exponent of the power-law distribution depends on the elasticicity parameter, which is a parameter that controls the conservation of energy when a block slides. We intend to replicate their experiment, and further investigate several properties. First, we will see whether the system exhibits SOC properties beyond just power-law distributions, which is the only property observed in the paper - i.e, we will explore whether they exhibit fractal geometry and pink noise. Second, we will investigate how the distribution of forces on each block affects the system; in Olami et al., the initial forces are randomly distributed. We will create "fault lines," clusters of blocks that begin with a high initial force on them, and explore how these clusters affect the behavior of the system as well as its SOC properties.

3) An annotated bibliography of 3-5 papers that relate to your topic and/or tools.  Explain what the papers are about, what experiments they report, and what their primary conclusions are.

4) Present 1-3 experiments from these papers that you plan to replicate and 1-3 extensions or variations of those experiments you are considering.

The main experiment we plan to replicate is Olami, Feder, and Christensen's earthquake experiment - we will create the cellular automata, run the simulation, and explore the power-law distribution of the earthquake magnitudes as in the original paper. From that point, we have two extensions planned. Firstly, we plan to investigate whether the system exhibits the other SOC properties of earthquakes: pink noise and fractal geometry. After that, we will modify the earthquake model so that the initial forces are clustered around certain areas that represent "fault lines;" after simulating this, we will investigate the same SOC properties as in the original experiment.

5) Sketch what the results from these experiments might look like, possibly using a cartoon of a graphical result.

6) Explain how you will interpret the results; for example, "If the power spectrum on a log-log scale is approximately linear, we will estimate its slope.  If that slope is near 1, we will conclude that the time series generated by model resembles pink noise."

The main interpretation we'll do is of the three critical graphs. The first graph is the distribution of earthquake magnitudes on a log-log scale (this is the graph that was included in the original paper); if the slope of this graph on a log-log scale is approximately a line, then we say taht the magnitudes of earthquakes follow a power-law distribution. They may also follow a similar heavy-tailed distribution such as a log-normal distribution. The next graph is the power of frequency of "relaxations" (i.e. the occurrences of blocks sliding); on a log-log scale, this should have a slope of approximately -1, in which case we interpret it as being pink noise. Finally, we will look at the number of "perturbed" (i.e. not in their equilibrium position) blocks as a function of the size of the system - on a log-log scale, if the slope of the line isn't an integer, we interpret the system as having fractal geometry.

7) Identify causes for concern.  Review the criteria for what makes a good project, (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and identify any areas where your project might be problematic.

The main area for concern in our project is in our extensions. As far as the implementation of the original paper goes, it has a fairly clear-cut question it's answering and there's enough documentation of the process to replicate it; however, for our replications, we are unsure of what to use as our metric for observing pink noise and fractal geometry. This is because this simulation doesn't have "states"  in the same way as other CA-based models, which will make finding some dimension for fractal geometry difficult. We have a few ideas for what to look at for fractal geometry though, such as the force on each block once the system returns to equilibrium. Our other extension, however, should allow us to answer useful questions about the world.

8) Outline next steps.  For each team member, what do you plan to work on immediately?  For the team, what do you think you can get done in the first week?  Consider using Trello (or a similar tool) to delegate and track tasks.

Our immediate first steps are to implement the original earthquake model. We plan to implement the model by breaking it into separate chunks for implementing the model and for running the model, displaying neat things, and computing statistics of interest.

**Matt:** My immediate next steps are to write the class to visualize the model and compute the statistics we care about. The statistic computing should be implementable very quickly, although writing a useful visualization might take somewhat longer.
**Evan:** My next steps are to write the implementation of the earthquake model. We plan to implement it by extending Cell2D, which should make implementation fairly simple.
