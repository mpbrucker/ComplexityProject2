### Project 2 Draft Review

### Question  
The question seems to be stated pretty clear in the abstract: you're exploring how noise affects the outbreak of cooperation among agents. However, it is less immediately apparent what exactly it is you're simulating. It appears as though it has something to do with agents and cooperation/defection, so some kind of agent-based prisoner's dilemma, but it isn't really made clear until the full introduction what exactly it is they're investigating. I think it might be easier to understand what it is you're investigating if you open with a brief explanation of the system you're studying to give context, then saying what question you're investigating.

### Methodology  
There's a lot of different elements being implemented here, and it gets a bit confusing as to which things are which. The idea of having a trust network is pretty well explained - it seems pretty east to understand! However, I'm still unsure of how the trust network is formed/changed; I understand how it works, but the actual mechanism that forms it seems unclear. The migration is well-explained, although it does get a bit difficult to keep all the different forms of migration apart.

### Results  
It's obviously hard to say what the results are without seeing the figures, but the one thing I would say is to perhaps add more quantitative explanation of things - both in terms of what your parameters were for various things like rates of migration, but also potentially for things like what your definition of clustering is. 

### Interpretation
The interpretation of the results does seem to explain what your original question it: under noisy conditions, cooperative communities do exist, but have a larger proportion of defectors. This seems like a pretty reasonable explanation, and I'm sure once ou have figures, etc. it can be supported by the results. It might flow a bit better to have this interpretation of the results from the original simulation before introducing everything from the extension, because it's a bit confusing to read about all the results from the extension, and then immediately after read the conclusion about the original experiment.

### Replication
It seems like you have a good understanding of the original experiment you're replicating. It would be helpful to have graphs from the original paper to compare to, or you could also just reference figures from the original paper. Apart from that, everything seems good!

### Extension
It's a bit unclear what you definite as being necessary for a "realistic" model - you propose changes that seem to make sense, but there doesn't seem to be an explicit statement of why those are needed in the context of the original model and question being asked. Also, your title talks about social networks, so it seems like there should be some kind of social network graphs going on, but every agent's trust graph is complete, so I'm a little unclear on how social networks come into aplay. Overall, I think adding some explanation of what your extension is trying to accomplish would help make it clearer.

### Progress
Everything seems to be on track - what you have for the results seems to indicate that you pretty much have the replication and extension done, so that's great!

### Presentation
Everything is written pretty clearly, and in correct person/tense/etc. I do think it may be helpful to break up some of the larger paragraphs, or to include subsections or something to help break it up and show the reader what to look at.

### Mechanics
Everything seems good!
