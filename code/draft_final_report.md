#### Abstract

In this paper, we explore a cellular automata-based model of simulating earthquakes. Replicating a model proposed by Olami, Feder, and Christensen, we simulate the behavior of earthquakes through a model of a grid of sliding blocks between two sliding plates. Each block is connected to its neighbors and
